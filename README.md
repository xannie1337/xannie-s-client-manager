No servers. No accounts. No BS. Just a local, fully client sided tool made for freelancers and creators who actually care about owning their data. Originally built as a quick solution for a homeboy [voohvn](https://x.com/voohvn) a video editor, then turned into a full featured manager for anyone tired of bloated "all in one" platforms.

## About This Project

Most tools in this space want your wallet or your data. This doesn’t. My Client Manager was built as a lightweight, browser-based app that runs entirely on your machine. No setup, no backend, nothing phoning home.

What started as a simple tool for a video editor ended up scaling well for other creators: graphic designers, motion designers, animators, 3D artists, video editors, producers, and basically anyone who works with clients directly.

Your data stays in your browser. No sync, no cloud, no leaks. If you close the tab, it’s still yours.

## Features

**Privacy First**  
- Runs 100% on the client side. Nothing leaves your machine. No accounts, no servers, no tracking.

**Client Overview**  
- Track client info, project status (Not Started / In Progress / Finished), payment progress, and more all from a single dashboard.

**Financials**  
- Input total amounts, discounts, platform fees, and payments it’ll calculate what’s due and what’s left. Automatically accounts for fees from PayPal, Wise, etc.

**Payment Logging**  
- Log each payment with method, amount, and optional notes. Built in fee estimation based on platform.

**Search & Filtering**  
- Find exactly what you need, instantly. Filter by project status, payment status, or just search by name or description.

**Theme Customization**  
- Change colors, backgrounds, text basically every major visual element. Themes get automatically saved to your browser.

**Data Portability**  
- One click import/export using a file. Great for backups or switching machines.

**Receipts**  
- Generate clean, ready to send receipts in the form of an image. Copy them to your clipboard or download them to preserve and send later.

**Polished UI**  
- Clean design, smooth transitions, and a "glass" visual style without the usual frontend bloat.

## Getting Started

No installs. No setup. Here’s how to use it:

1. Clone the repo or download the `index.html` file.
2. Open it in your browser.
3. That’s it. You're in.
> **Note**
> I'll include a tiny Chrome extension I've written for my previous project that lets the user set keybinds to quickly access the HTML file based on its directory.
